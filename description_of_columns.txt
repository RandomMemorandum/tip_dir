This document explains what each column stands for within the project.

Some columns simply describe a number, like tips, for tips earned that day; 
while other columns are calculated fields based on other columns such as no_hours, 
for the length of the shift in hours, which is simply the end time minus the start time.

Several variables here are boolean, that are created for the sake of filtering the data based on certain characteristics.
