Donatos Pizza is a chain restaurant based in Columbus Ohio where it was
founded in 1963.<br><br>

It is served as ‘Columbus-style’ which has a thin crust, is cut in
squares and has edge-to-edge toppings.<br><br>

Jim Grote began the pizza chain in the south side of the city on Thurman
ave, but one of the early planted stores was the one on the Ohio State
campus area on High St, where I worked.<br><br>

Today Donatos has stores in many states, but keeps its great presence in
Columbus and at The Ohio State University, where it serves pizza at Ohio
State football games, and inside the major venues of the Schottenstein
Center.<br><br>

Some notes about Donatos and the campus location. The pizza chain is
normally open from 11 AM to midnight, Monday through Thursday; and until
1:30 AM Friday and Saturday night.<br><br>

On the campus location, alcohol and liquor is served, which makes up a
decent amount of sales during the home football games.
