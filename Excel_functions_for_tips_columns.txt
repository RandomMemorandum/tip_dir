This document records the excel functions that are used to generate the additional columns used in the worksheet.

We have entered 4 columns already:

	date		date of shift, in MM/DD/YYYY format
	shift		beginning hour and end hour of shift, like 11-4 
	no_orders	number of separate orders delivered
	tips		total dollar amount taken home that night


From these we can extract additional information,
Right away we can get the name of the month, the day of the week, and the year


# ======== Day, Month, Year ========

We do this with =TEXT()

	month-column	=TEXT([date-column-cell], "mm")

	year-column		=TEXT([date-column-cell], "yyyy")

	day-of-week		=TEXT([date-column-cell], "ddd")


# ======== Start time, end time, length of shift

We also parse the starttime and endtime from the shift-column

	start_time 		=LEFT([shift-column], SEARCH("-", [shift-column])-1)

	end_time 		=TRIM( RIGHT ([shift-column],
					    (LEN([shift-column])-
					    SEARCH( "-", [shift-column]))))

Once we have separated the starttime and endtime, we can learn the length of the shift

	no_hours	  =(([end-date-column]+[end-time-column]])-
				      ([start_date_column]+[start-time-column]))
				      *24


# ======== Creating 'Short North variable' ========

# this column returns a 1 if the day is Monday or Wednesday, and the shift is opening

	Short_north		=IF(L2=1,IF(OR([day_of_week-column]="Mon",C2="Fri"),1,0),0)



# ======== Creating 'Day shift variable' ========

# day_shift tells us whether the shift began before 2 PM or not
# very few shifts would begin before 2 PM that were not opening shifts

	day_shift		=IF([start_time-column] < (TIME(14,0,0)),1, 0)



# ======== Creating 'Harsh_night variable' ========

# this column is created in order to separate all sales and orders that occur after 4 PM. 
# this is the time that the Donatos shift change occurs, and so, in order to make a 
# comparison between the model and the actual sales, we use the same threshold
	
	harsh_night 	=IF([start_time-column] < (TIME(16,0,0)),0,1)
